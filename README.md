# odin-recipies
<p>In this project, I will test and prove my ability to create a standard, html website using the skills I have learned while using <strong>The Odin Project</strong>.</p>
<p>This project's name is <em>Recipes</em>, where I will be creating links on my main website to other recipies over the internet.</p>
<p><em>Edit: Testing if I can add descriptions directly from GItHub without using codes.</em></p>
